# Fractaflower Sunflower

A simple canvas implementation of the Fibonacci phyllotaxis pattern you
see so common in radial symmetries nature:  sunflowers, pinecones, leaf orientations,
pineapples, etc.

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/650821/Fractals-in-theory-and-practice has a pretty good rundown of the math involved.

TODO: Actually make a physical model simulation and hope the fractal
pattern emerges.

^^this video shows what the basic physical mechanisms are:  particles
are bound to a substrate and repel equipotentially.  However, particles
emerge in substrate at discrete time intervals; at some apical center.
